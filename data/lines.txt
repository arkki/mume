Ok.
Nothing.

You will swim if necessary.
You will try to climb even under unsafe conditions.
You begin to feel hungry.
You are hungry.
You are full.
You begin to feel thirsty.
You are thirsty.
You feel less thirsty.
You do not feel thirsty anymore.
You are not thirsty anymore.

You sit down and rest your tired bones.
You stop resting, and stand up.
You are already standing.
You are already resting.
Your head stops stinging.

You are too exhausted.
Alas, you cannot go that way...
Nothing special there...
You begin to search...
You don't see anything special there...
No-one by that name here...

Your mount cautiously descends the slippery slope.
You swiftly scale the ladder.
You climb down the white ladder.
As you walk down the stairs, the sound of the fountain slowly fades.
Following the spiralling stair, you slowly descend to the top of the great hill.
Descending a flight of stairs you find yourself on flat ground.
A vague and elusive sound resembling singing comes from the city.
A shadow of a small ship appears on the surface of the bowl and fades away.
As night falls, a silver lamp begins to burn brighter, springing to life like a star after the sunset.
A white stair takes you higher up on the slope.
The mallorn trees whisper a gentle greeting as Anarwen enters the shrine.
Scaling the stairs you arrive on a higher level of the hill.
Climbing out of the deep fosse is somewhat tiring.
As you climb down the deep fosse, you are immersed in grey shadows.
As you climb down into the deep fosse, you are immersed in grey shadows.
Ascending the polished white steps you reach the crown of the hill.
Stars glimmer briefly on the surface of the water in the bowl. As a breath of wind stirs the water, they dissolve.
A feeling of peace envelops you as you enter the enchanted forest.
A mass of dark green leaves clings to a wall.
Taking a pitcher from behind a shrub, Anarwen waters the flowers.
The flowers seem to nod their heads.
Faint voices can be heard from across the bridge.

As Ecthelion pumps some air into the forge, the fire flares up brightly.
Ecthelion thrusts the helm into the flames, which engulf it.
The forge exhales a puff of foul-smelling smoke, and some molten metal flows down a chute into the depths of the forge.
Ecthelion wipes his brow.

You begin to see some clouds.
The ground is frozen solid.
The water is frozen solid.
The fog disappears.
It starts to snow.
The snow has stopped.
The lightning has stopped.
There is some snow on the ground.
Lightning starts to show in the sky.
Snow falls gently from the sky, creating a white blanket over the flat ground.
Delicate flakes of snow fall gently from the sky, covering the roofs and the streets.
A sudden chorus of birds greets the rising sun.
The sun sinks slowly below the tops of the golden trees on its way to the lands beyond the Sea.
There is a lot of snow on the ground.
You don't see any more snow here.
The deepening gloom announces another sunset outside.
Light gradually filters in, proclaiming a new sunrise outside.
As daylight grows, the light of a silver lamp seems to grow dim, like the light of a star after the sunrise.

You receive your share of experience.
It begins to be automatic...
Yes! You're beginning to get the idea.

There is an old street-lamp on the border of the street.

You begin to feel the light of Aman shine upon you.
The light of Aman fades away from you.
A strange feeling runs through your body.
A magic mushroom suddenly appears.
You can't concentrate enough while resting.

You are a firm believer in the values of Right and Wrong.

You are not known for any acts of war.

No more skills need refreshing.
An elf guides you to an unused section of the pavilion, where you can rest for a while in privacy behind lightly coloured screens.
You can explore world map offline or try to reconnect again...
